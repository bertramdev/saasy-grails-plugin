There are currently 2 active branches, master and java-8. The master branch is for apps that are still running Java7 and Tomcat7. The java-8 branch uses the newer http library http-builder-ng, https://github.com/http-builder-ng/http-builder-ng. This library is the successor to the httpbuilder library and actively maintained but requires at least Java8 hence the branch name "java-8".
